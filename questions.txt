does server also need a caching function since we are creating bidirectional

I'm thinking we may need to create an RTP object that stores expected numbers and whatnot
	but i might just be stuck in an OOP mentality. That's what I started.
	
I'm trying to prevent duplication by putting everything in the RTP object: linked list for caching,
current sequence number, etc.
